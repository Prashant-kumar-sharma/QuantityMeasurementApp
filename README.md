# Quantity Measurement App – UC10 (Generic Quantity Class with Unit Interface)

### 📌 Overview

- This module refactors the previous category-specific Quantity classes into a single, generic `Quantity<U>` class that works with any measurement category implementing the `IMeasurable` interface.
- It eliminates code duplication, simplifies demonstration methods, and ensures type-safe operations across multiple measurement categories like length and weight.

### ⚙️ Use Case: UC10 – Generic Quantity and Multi-Category Support

- Accepts two numerical values with their respective units
- Supports equality comparison, unit conversion, and addition
- Prevents invalid cross-category comparisons (e.g., length vs. weight)
- Returns a new `Quantity` object for conversion or addition; equality returns a boolean

### ⚙️ Key Implementation Points

- Uses a single generic class: `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>`
- Holds private final fields: `value` and `unit` (immutable)
- `IMeasurable` interface standardises unit behaviour across categories
- Enums (`LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`) implement `IMeasurable` and encapsulate conversion logic
- `equals()` compares base unit values using `Double.compare()` and validates unit types
- `convertTo(U targetUnit)` delegates to the unit’s conversion methods and returns new instance
- `add(Quantity<U> other)` and `add(Quantity<U> other, U targetUnit)` perform arithmetic safely
- `hashCode()` and `toString()` overridden for collections and readable output
- Type safety ensured at compile-time via generics; runtime unit class checks prevent cross-category errors
- Demonstration methods in `QuantityMeasurementApp` are generic and unified for all categories

# Quantity Measurement App – UC11 (Volume Equality, Conversion, and Addition)

### 📌 Overview

- This module extends the Quantity Measurement Application to support **volume measurements** (litres, millilitres, gallons).
- It demonstrates equality comparison, unit conversion, and addition operations for volume, leveraging the generic `Quantity<U>` class and `IMeasurable` interface. - Volume is treated as a separate category from length and weight, validating the scalability of the generic architecture.

### ⚙️ Use Case:  UC11 – Volume Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition

- Accepts numerical values with their respective volume units (LITRE, MILLILITRE, GALLON)
- Compares volumes for equality
- Converts between volume units
- Adds two volume quantities, optionally specifying a target unit

### ⚙️ Key Implementation Points

- `VolumeUnit` enum implements `IMeasurable` with LITRE as the base unit
- Conversion factors: MILLILITRE = 0.001 L, GALLON ≈ 3.78541 L
- Equality uses base unit comparison with epsilon tolerance
- Generic `Quantity<U>` handles conversion and addition without modification
- Maintains type safety: volume cannot be mixed with length or weight
- Objects are immutable; addition and conversion return new instances
